## dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

## Prerequisites

The following assumptions are made:

- [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/) is used instead of Terminal.app
- [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is used
- Latest version of tmux is installed from homebrew
- Latest version of zsh is installed from homebrew
- Latest version of vim or neovim is installed from homebrew
- Latest version of fzf and the_silver_searcher from homebrew
- User shell is changed to the homebrew version `/usr/local/bin/zsh`

## Base16 Colours

I use the [base16](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/) theme tomorrow dark.
Make sure to load the iTerm2 colour pallete from `~/.colours/base16-iterm2`.

If you wish to use a different colour, simply change the `colourscheme` in `~/.vimrc` and
the colourspace script loaded in `~/.zshrc.`

## Installation

**Backup your existing dotfiles first.**

1. Clone the repo `git clone --recursive https://github.com/wooly/dotfiles.git`
2. Run `ruby go.rb`
3. Import the base-16 iTerm2 colour scheme into iTerm2.
4. Launch vim, ignoring any errors, and run `:PlugInstall`.
